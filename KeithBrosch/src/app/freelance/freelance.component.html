    I have been creating client websites on and off for the better part of 2 years. In July of 2018 I was hired on a 6 month contract by Premier Communications Group, a marketing agency in Royal Oak, MI. Premier specializes in branding and advertisement, and only occasionally has clients who request to have websites made. In fact, before they hired me, they were paying a freelancer on the other side of the state to maintain the few client sites that they had at the time. They had just landed a big client in the real estate industry who needed multiple websites made for their recently purchased properties and decided that they needed in in-house developer. During my time as the companyâ€™s sole developer I created several websites including <a href="http://parcdetroit.com/" target="_blank">parcdetroit.com</a>, <a href="http://www.anchorbardetroit.com/" target="_blank">anchorbardetroit.com</a>, and <a href="https://pinnacle-mi.com/" target="_blank">pinnacle-mi.com</a>. Towards the end of my time at Premier, the art director grew unhappy at the company and left. He offered me an opportunity to work for his new Company as a freelance developer, which I have been doing since January 2019.
