  <p class="title">Marketing Intelligence Cloud Data Management App – Urban Science (2019)</p>
  <hr />

  <p>
    Urban Science has one of the deepest, most accurate automotive datasets in the world. They deliver data directly to their clients through a web-based API platform known as the MIC (Marketing Intelligence Cloud). Their clients have varying access to these endpoints and their configurations need to be maintained. Furthermore, their business partners often need to analyze the data that is in the platform. When I first began this project, these maintenance activities were largely performed manually by developers which was time consuming, inefficient, and error prone. During my senior capstone project at Wayne State, myself and 3 fellow students developed a set of administrative tools to allow Urban Science’s business partners to directly manage their clients' data. The data in the MIC is very sensitive, so we were only given an initial set of JSON files containing mock data that simulated some data in the MIC. Using this mock data we initialized a MongoDB Database, created our own Web API, and built a front-end application to interact with it. I was the front-end lead for our group, and both Urban Science and our professor were extremely satisfied with the final result. At the end of the semester we handed the project over to Urban Science, which they began to integrate into their live working environment.
