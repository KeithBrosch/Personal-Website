  <p>Hello!</p>
  <br />
  <p>I am a Web Developer from Detroit.</p>
  <p>
    In December of 2019 I graduated from Wayne State University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
    I have 2+ years of experience developing client websites, and am looking for an opportunity to develop professionally in a JavaScript framework, preferably Angular.
